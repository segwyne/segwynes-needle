        <h1>About page</h1>
        <p>My name is Judy and I have been sewing for 25 years.  I started out making costumes for live role-playing games, then moved up to historical medieval clothing.  Over the years I have earned a Career Diploma in Dressmaking and Design and learned how to draft patterns from raw measurements.  Historical and fantasy clothing is my main focus, but I also enjoy making regular clothes for myself and my children.</p>
        <p>I was part of the Society for Creative Anachronism (www.sca.org) in the Barony of Stonemarche, for some years, where I played a Viking-era Norsewoman named Temair. I also played for a few years back in the late 90s with NERO, the New England Role-playing Organization</p>
        <p>I decided to start a sewing business because sewing is my creative outlet.  I don't have room to store all the clothes I want to make, and they have to start paying for themselves.  I am planning on putting up a showcase of my work, but first I need to get nice pictures taken, so please check back later.</p>
        <p>Thank you for stopping by.  I hope you enjoy your visit.</p>
