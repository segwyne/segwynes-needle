        <h1>About page</h1>
        <p>My name is Judy and I have been sewing for 25 years.  I started out making costumes for live role-playing games, then moved up to historical medieval clothing.  Over the years I have earned a Career Diploma in Dressmaking and Design and learned how to draft patterns from raw measurements.   I make clothing, rather than costumes, inspired by pre-20th century designs.</p>
        <p>I was part of the <a href="http://sca.org/">Society for Creative Anachronism</a> in the <a href="https://stonemarche.eastkingdom.org/">Barony of Stonemarche</a>, for some years, where I played a Viking-era Norsewoman named Temair. I also played for a few years back in the late 90s with NERO, the New England Role-playing Organization.  I currently attend events at <a href="http://fortat4.org">The Fort at No. 4</a>, an 18th Century open air museum.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for stopping by.  I hope you enjoy your visit.</p>
